# 99-Haskell-Problems

Solutions to (a sublist of) a list of Haskell problems found <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems">here</a>.

If you see me define a function that's built into Haskell, just assume I did it for practice (or in accordance with the rules for that problem) and definitely not because I didn't know it existed. If you see me define a weird datatype, it's probably because these used to be Lisp problems and Lisp can do things Haskell can't (like have heterogenous lists).
